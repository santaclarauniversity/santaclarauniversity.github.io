# Santa Clara University Digital Assets

This is our first attempt at completing an **automated build**.

### Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
$ gulp
```
Get the dependencies for Gulp:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Documentation is made with `jekyll` - build the docs:

```sh
$ gem install jekyll
$ cd docs
$ jekyll serve
```

### To-do:
* Template demonstrations should become the style guide.
* Make actual tasks for gulp; `build`, `deploy`
