## What you need

Put this line anywhere into `<head>..</head>`

```markup
<link href="http://brand.scu.edu/css/toolkit.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

Put this line toward the end of `body`, just before `</body></html>`

```markup
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://brand.scu.edu/js/compiled-bundle.min.js"></script>
```

Open a tab for brand.scu.edu.

## Adding content

1. Go to **Content Types** section via brand.scu.edu
2. Enable show code via the `</>` button

<img src="/assets/images/docs/getting-started/show-code.png" alt="</> button" style="height:320px;width:auto" />

3. Copy the code of whichever content type you want to add and paste it to where you want it on your page

For example, if I want to add a new **Button**, I would:
1. Go to Content Types -> Button
2. Enable Show Code (note there is also a `</>` button next to each Content Type)
3. Copy the code that I want. In this case, I want a **Primary Standard Button** so I'll copy
```markup
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
```


## Structuring content

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/

Toolkit is designed with **Bootstrap 4**. The documentation above provides all you need to know about manipulating Bootstrap 4. You might need to use the documentation to help you lay out pages or adjust content types.

**You can also check brand.scu.edu for demos of full pages and more docs on stuff like our typography.** Everything on Brand is navigable in the same left-hand menu you found the Content Types in, just scroll down to view the [Style Guide](/style-guide.html), [Demos](/demos.html), and [Docs](/docs.html) sections.
