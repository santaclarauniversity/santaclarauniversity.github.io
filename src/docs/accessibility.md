Here's what you need to know about accessibility and code:
* All code submissions to the Toolkit must be accessible.
* WCAG 2.0/AA is the technical standard that we follow, but we should design with accessibility best practices in mind.
* The [University Accessibility Policy](https://scu.edu/accessibility) requires third-party deliverables to be fully accessible.

The Toolkit has accessibility auditing capabilities (`gulp a11y`) that can be used to audit content. In addition to automated tools, pages should be checked using [WebAIM WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/). Pages and content should have 0 errors according to WAVE reports.

WAVE will not detect all accessibility issues. It is your responsibility to ensure that websites are accessible. A few errors that may not be detected by the tool are:
* Color contrast issues. Use a [Contrast Checker](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/).
* JavaScript interactivity and progressive enhancement
* Effective contextual information, such as alt tags, need to be descriptive.

If you have questions about accessible contributions to the toolkit or new websites, please contact [Nic Bertino](mailto:nbertino@scu.edu), Director of Digital Strategy.
