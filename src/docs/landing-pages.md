`Draft Guidelines`

We recognize that sometimes user needs and business goals necessitate (and sometimes require) a unique digital experience. In anticipating this need, we have integrated landing pages into our design language that can help address any needs not covered by our current design.

Here are some guidelines for landing pages:
* **Every design project should be attempted in our pattern library.** Using existing resources helps us keep our brand consistent across various experiences. We should attempt to expand the design language to accommodate requests before selecting a landing page.
* **There must be a demonstrated business or user need that justifies a new design.** Examples of this include initiative-based websites or special projects.
* **Landing pages still play by the brand rules.** That means colors, fonts, and other design elements must be preserved.
* **OMC has the ultimate approval for new landing page rollouts.** We will work with you to determine if using one of our landing page designs is the best route given your user tasks and business goals.
