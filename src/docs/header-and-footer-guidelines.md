`Draft Guidelines`

### Header Guidelines

Our header system is designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and flexible. The header design has two primary layouts, **core layout** and **customized layout**:

---

<h4 class="text-primary">Core Layout</h4>

The core layout is a general SCU header and navigation.

**Used For:**

* SCU homepage
* Prospective student-oriented pages
* Non-academic departments and offices

**Not used for:**
* Schools, initiatives, or centers (use Customized Layout)

---

<h4 class="text-primary">Customized Layout</h4>

The customized layout is intended for use on pages with their own visual identity or where a segment-specific navigation improves user experience.

##### Customization Options

The custom layout is designed to accommodate a number of elements.

###### Branding

The branding section, by default, is a text-based logo set in Trade Light with the name of your school, department, or unit. Trade Bold, Bodoni Italic, and Bodoni Bold Italic are also typography options for centers or initiative-based websites. The maximum width of content in this area is **280px.**

This header is designed to flex vertically if your content exceeds the height of the bar. If you are looking to use a graphic, it should be **280px** wide.

###### Navigation Options

We have tested the header with up to **seven (7)** navigation items, and encourage you to use up to that amount. The customized footer also contains up to nine (9) different navigation elements.

**Do not:**
* Modify or remove the "Santa Clara University" branding/homepage link in the topmost bar.
* Remove or change the Search icon or modify the search placeholders or behavior.

### Footer Guidelines

Similar to the header system, the redesigned footers offer a **core layout** and a **customized layout**.

#### Core Footer

The core footer contains SCU's contact information, social media links, and general links. This layout should not be modified.
 
#### Customized Footer

The customized footer offers unit-specific branding, including **customizable contact information** and **social media links to your pages**.
 
There is also three columns of link space available for your use, and we encourage you to put unique links into this area and avoid duplication with your header.

Here are some examples of common pages that work well in a footer:

* About
* Faculty Listings
* Staff Listings
* Contact Us

**Do not:**
* Modify or remove the **Santa Clara University** branding/homepage link in the bottom-most bar.
* Remove or change the **Login**, **Facebook**, or **Twitter** icons in the bottom-most bar.
* Remove the Accessibility link or copyright information.
