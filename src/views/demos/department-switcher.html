      <div class="intro"><p>From nanobots to the national grid, electrical engineers create the systems that power our
        world.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The field of electrical engineering is vast. It covers the design, construction, and operation of every kind of
        electrical component, circuit, and system. It's integral to modern life and necessary if we are to build a more
        sustainable world. Where better to become an electrical engineer than in the heart of Silicon Valley?</p>
      <p>At Santa Clara, you'll study with distinguished&nbsp;<a
        href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/faculty--staff/">faculty members</a>
        who bring industry challenges to their classrooms and research. They've developed a curriculum that is both
        practical and innovative, and takes care to address ethical and societal impacts.</p>
      <p>You'll get hands-on experience in <a
        href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/laboratories/">facilities</a>&nbsp;like
        the Nanoelectronics, Intelligent Control, and Electron Device Laboratories as well as through our <a
          href="/engineering/beyond-the-classroom/co-ops-and-internships/">co-op program</a>, internship opportunities,
        and independent projects.</p>
      <p>Our <a href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/undergraduate/">Bachelor's</a>,
        <a href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/graduate/ms-program/">Master's</a>,
        and <a
          href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/graduate/phd-program/">Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;degrees
        all offer specializations, and our <a
          href="/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/graduate/certificate-programs/">graduate
          certificate programs</a>&nbsp;provide a quick way to become skilled in a specific area.</p>
      <p>SCU EE graduates are highly sought-after for their technical knowledge and leadership skills here in the Valley
        and beyond.</p>

                graduate program. Read about Electrical Engineering’s Bob Schaffer, Ph.D., who exemplifies the best in
                engineering education and the Jesuit tradition of helping others.</p><a
