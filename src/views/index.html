<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This UI toolkit is a highly-modular design system for rapid web page development. It contains different materials that can be assembled into more complex page layouts.</p>

<p>The SCU website calls its materials <em>content types</em>, some of which operate by themselves, and some of which can be assembled to create something whole on a larger scale (for example, a <em>Story Display</em> of several <em>Story</em> types).</p>

<p>By using content types, content creators are able to piece together webpages by focusing solely on the content that pertains to their part of the website.  The rest of the content forms the headers, footers, and navigation, which are described as <em>pages</em> that are included outside of the scope of content types.</p>

<p>This guide contains real working examples, code snippets, documentation, and style guidelines.</p>
