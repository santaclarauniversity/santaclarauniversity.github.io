        Students may transfer up to 9-quarter units of graduate-level (post-baccalaureate) coursework from other accredited institutions. Courses to be considered for transfer must have been completed within five years of the initial enrollment date in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology. Transferred credits only apply to the specific course for which the exemption is sought.

        While the immersion has ended, the full experience is a journey that is never truly over. More than an end goal, we believe that the immersion itself is a starting point for ongoing reflective and critical engagement of the realities of our local and global community. For this reason, participants commit to meeting at least 3 times upon return from the trip to continue processing, sharing stories, and determining next steps toward integrating the immersion experience into life at Santa Clara and beyond. Immersion companions, Ignatian staff members, and other members of the Santa Clara community are here as a resource to assist as you integrate your immersion into post-immersion life.
