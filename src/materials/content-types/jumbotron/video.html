notes: There are special usage notes and restrictions for using videos in jumbotrons. Videos used in this context must be purely decorative. They cannot have audio or appear to have people speaking. The ideal length is 10-16 seconds long (at 720p). Avoid fast moving images, flashing lights, or fast-cut editing.
